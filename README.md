### -- Project Status: Completed
Project Intro/Objective

I have created a dataset involving employee purchases.  The purpose of this project is to demostrate my skills using a VBA macros to calculate accounting spreadsheets.    

### Methods Used

    * SUMPRODUCT
    * VLOOKUP
    * Conditional Statements
    * Excel Formatting

### Technologies

    * Microsoft Excel 2019

### Project Description

I have tasked myself with calcuating employee accounting purchases for the new office.  Each employee is assigned to purchase supplies such as pens, pencils, paper and printers.  Every employee must purchase their own personal computer and chair.  To calculate these purchases, I will use a VBA macros by opening the Developer tab.  The workbook is broken up into 3 sheets, "Instructions", "Invoice", and "Income."


### Invoice Sheet Columns

    * Invoice = The invoice number assigned with the employee's personal receipt
    * Item = The description of the item
    * Units = Number of units purchased
    * Unit Cost = Cost per unit
    * Total = (Units)*(Unit Cost)

### Income Sheet Columns

    * OrderDate = The date when the employee made the purchase
    * Invoice = The invoice number assigned with the employee's personal receipt
    * Region = The location of the branch office
    * Rep = Employee's last name
    * Before Taxes = The total cost shown without any sale tax accounted for
    * Expensive Comp = Whether or not the employee purchased a computer over $500
    * Total Cost = The final costs of all individual employee purchases
    
## Rules For Calculations

    * Employees that bought expensive computers will get 10% discount
    * Invoices after 1/1/2020 need to account for the sale tax of 4%

## Needs of this project

    * VBA Macro
    * Data Cleaning
    * Writeup & Reporting
